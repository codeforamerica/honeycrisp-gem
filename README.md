## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cfa-styleguide', git: 'https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfa-styleguide-gem'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cfa-styleguide

## Usage

1. Add `@import 'cfa_styleguide_main';` to application.scss.

1. Add `//= require cfa_styleguide_main` to application.js.

1. Add `mount Cfa::Styleguide::Engine => "/cfa"` to routes.rb.

1. Visit any of the following routes to view the styleguides:

    ```
    `<your hostname>/cfa/styleguide`
    `<your hostname>/cfa/styleguide/cbo-dashboard`
    `<your hostname>/cfa/styleguide/cbo-analytics`
    `<your hostname>/cfa/styleguide/current`
    `<your hostname>/cfa/styleguide/custom-docs`
    ```

1. (Optional) To override the styleguide's variables (e.g. use `#000000` for `$color-background` rather than as defined in the gem), require your own file that redefines the variables in your application.scss like so:

    ```scss
    @import 'my_variable_file'
    @import 'cfa_styleguide_main'

    ```


1. (Optional) To use variables provided by the style guide gem remove `require_tree` directives from your `application.scss` and use use `@import` statements instead ([from stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6269420/sass-global-variables-not-being-passed-to-partials/9055230#9055230))

    ```scss
    # do not use
    *= require_tree .
    ```
    
    ```scss
    # use instead
    @import 'things_to_import'
    ```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You must install Chromedriver to run tests; on MacOS with Homebrew, run `brew bundle install`

Run `bin/rails s` to start a webserver with a test app that has the engine mounted, then visit `http://localhost:3000`.

If the gem is being used in another project's Gemfile, the source can be locally overridden within the other project's Gemfile by running `bundle config local.cfa-styleguide /path/to/cfa-styleguide-gem`, and undone with `bundle config --delete local.cfa-styleguide`

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 

### Running tests

A small test suite is available—please add to it!

To run, run `rake` or `rspec spec`.

### Releasing new gem versions

To release a new version, on `master`:
* Update the version number in `version.rb` using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
* Generate a changelog using `bundle exec rake changelog`. (Note: you will need to provide a [Github token with public repo access](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator#github-token)). Review, edit as necessary, and commit including the version update.
* Run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, and push git commits and tags to Github. In the future, this will also push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
