# Honeycrisp Design System

A gem including base styles and javascript for Code for America products, for use in Rails applications.

View the current version of the styleguide at [https://honeycrisp.herokuapp.com](https://honeycrisp.herokuapp.com).

## Contributing

We are not currently seeking contributions from the public.

If you have any thoughts or questions about the project, get in touch at <a href="mailto:styleguide@codeforamerica.org">styleguide@codeforamerica.org</a> or the `#honeycrisp-design-system` channel in the Code for America Slack.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cfa-styleguide', git: 'https://github.com/codeforamerica/honeycrisp-gem', branch: :main
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cfa-styleguide

## Upgrading

The styleguide gem is pre-1.0.0 release, and should be considered as being in beta.

We do our best to keep things stable between minor version releases; 
however, decisions about deprecation and breaking changes are made given our knowledge about
the usage of the gem by active projects maintained and developed by Code for America staff.

**When upgrading the gem between patch versions** (e.g. 0.7.1 to 0.7.2), expect no breakage.

**When upgrading the gem between minor versions** (e.g. 0.7.1 to 0.8.0), be sure to review the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) and [migration guide](./MIGRATING.md).

If you encounter any breaking changes that we have not documented, please let us know by opening an issue!

## Usage

1. To use the Honeycrisp CSS, you have two options:
    1. To use all, `@import 'cfa_styleguide_main';` to `application.scss`. This file includes all SCSS present in the gem.
    1. To use selectively (recommended), import individual SCSS files into your `application.scss`. Here is an example:
       ```       
        /* Vendor */
        @import 'bourbon';
        @import 'neat/neat';
        @import "normalize";
       
        @import 'honeycrisp/atoms/variables';
        @import 'variables'; // example of in-app overide
       
        /* Atoms */
        @import 'honeycrisp/atoms/grid';
        @import 'honeycrisp/atoms/base';
        @import 'honeycrisp/atoms/spacing';
        @import 'honeycrisp/atoms/utilities';
        @import 'honeycrisp/atoms/typography';
        
        /* Molecules */
        @import 'honeycrisp/molecules/data-table';
        
        /* Organisms */
        @import 'honeycrisp/organisms/sidebar';
        
        /* Templates */
        @import 'honeycrisp/templates/styleguide';
       
        /* Your custom SCSS */
       ```
       
       **Note**: If you take this approach, be sure to include `bourbon`, `neat`, and `normalize`, as they are vendorized dependencies for our grid system and other styles.

1. Add `//= require cfa_styleguide_main` to application.js.

1. Add `mount Cfa::Styleguide::Engine => "/cfa"` to routes.rb.

1. Visit any of the following routes to view the styleguides:

    ```
    `<your hostname>/cfa/styleguide`
    `<your hostname>/cfa/styleguide/cbo-dashboard`
    `<your hostname>/cfa/styleguide/cbo-analytics`
    `<your hostname>/cfa/styleguide/current`
    `<your hostname>/cfa/styleguide/custom-docs`
    ```

## Customizing Styles when using `cfa_styleguide_main.scss`

To override the styleguide's variables (e.g. use `#000000` for `$color-background` rather than as defined in the gem), require your own file that redefines the variables in your `application.scss` like so:

    ```scss
    @import 'my_variable_file'
    @import 'cfa_styleguide_main'

    ``` 

To use variables provided by the style guide gem remove `require_tree` directives from your `application.scss` and use use `@import` statements instead ([from stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6269420/sass-global-variables-not-being-passed-to-partials/9055230#9055230))

    ```scss
    # do not use
    *= require_tree .
    ```
    
    ```scss
    # use instead
    @import 'things_to_import'
    ```


## Development

1. Check out the repo
1. Make sure you have the version of ruby specificed in `.ruby-version`
1. Run `gem install bundler`
   - if you see an error like `Can't find gem bundler (>= 0.a) with executable bundle (Gem::GemNotFoundException)` you can fix it by running `gem install bundler -v "$(grep -A 1 "BUNDLED WITH" Gemfile.lock | tail -n 1)"` [details here](https://bundler.io/blog/2019/05/14/solutions-for-cant-find-gem-bundler-with-executable-bundle.html)
1. run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.

You must install Chromedriver to run tests; on MacOS with Homebrew, run `brew bundle install`

Run `bin/rails s` to start a webserver with a test app that has the engine mounted, then visit `http://localhost:3000`.

### Overriding this gem locally in another project

If the gem is being used in another project's Gemfile, the source can be locally overridden within the other project's Gemfile in two ways:

1. Change the bundler configuration to use the local gem repository

    In the terminal, run `bundle config local.cfa-styleguide /path/to/honeycrisp-gem`

    To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
  
    When finished with development, remove this configuration by running `bundle config --delete local.cfa-styleguide` and `bundle install`
  
1. Change your Gemfile to point to the local gem repository 

    Alternatively, you can change host project's `Gemfile` to point to a local copy of this repository. For example, changing:

    ```
    gem 'cfa-styleguide', '~> 0.7', github: 'codeforamerica/honeycrisp-gem'
    ```
    to
    ```
    gem 'cfa-styleguide', '~> 0.7', path: '../honeycrisp-gem'
    ```
    
    where `../honeycrisp-gem` is the path (relative or absolute) to this repo on the local filesystem.
    
    After updating the `Gemfile` with these changes, you will need to run `bundle install`.
    
    When finish, just revert the Gemfile to the original version and `bundle install` again.


### How do I use this outside a Ruby project?
Run `rake assets:package`

Check the `dist` directory for all the assets required and copy/paste them into your project!

### Running tests

A small test suite is available—please add to it!

To run, run `rake` or `rspec spec`.

### Releasing new gem versions

Before you start:

- Determine whether this is major, minor, or patch release according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
- If a major or minor release, update and commit the [migration guide](./MIGRATING.md)
- Ensure you have a `.env` file with a Github Personal Access Token (`CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN=`) so that the Changelog data can be retrieved from the Github API.

To release a new version, on `main` branch run:

```bash
# Update version number, changelog, and create git commit:
$ bundle exec rake release[patch] # major, minor, patch

# ...and follow subsequent directions.
```

_If you see the error `zsh: no matches found`, escape the square brackets. e.g. `bundle exec rake release\[patch\].`_
