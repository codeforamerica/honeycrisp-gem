# Migration Guide

## Migrating from <= 0.11.x to 0.12.0
In `0.12.0` we improved the accessibility of the Reveal component. Now the link that opened the reveal is a button with `aria-expanded` attributes which enables VoiceOver to announce the collapsed/expanded state of the reveal when clicked/toggled via keyboard in Safari.
Make sure to update any references to `.reveal__link` to `.reveal__button` in your repository if present.

*Note*: this does not currently work in Chrome/Firefox.

See [pull request](https://github.com/codeforamerica/honeycrisp-gem/pull/317/files) for full details.

## Migrating from <= 0.10.x to 0.11.0
Honeycrisp version `0.11.0` requires Ruby 3.0 or higher, so make sure you're
using a modern Ruby.

## Migrating from <= 0.9.x to 0.10.0

In `0.10.0`, SCSS files have now been namespaced into `stylesheets/honeycrisp`, from `stylesheets`.

If you imported the manifest (ie as `import 'cfa_styleguide_main'` in `application.scss`), no changes are needed.

If you imported SCSS files directly from Honeycrisp (e.g. `@import 'atoms/base';` in `application.scss`) then you will need to update your imports to have a `honeycrisp/` prefix (e.g. `@import 'atoms/base'` becomes `@import 'honeycrisp/atoms/base';`).

## Migrating from <= 0.8.x to 0.9.0

### Breaking changes: SASS variables
In `0.9.0`, various SASS variables have been removed and will cause breakage if they're continued to be used in the host application.
